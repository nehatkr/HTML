            Typically, modern art is understood to include Impressionism, Abstract Expressionism, and the styles in between.
             Therefore, contemporary art commences with the first major movement following modernism—Pop Art—and, 
             of course, continues today.</p>

             What are 3 characteristics of modern art?<br>
             While contemporary modern art can be hard to define,
             there are some basic characteristics that are commonly associated with it. 
             Contemporary modern art is often abstract, experimental, and process-based.
             Contemporary modern art refers to a period of art production that began in the late 1940s and extends through to the present day.
              Contemporary modern art is characterized by a rejection of traditional values and conventions, and an embrace of abstraction, experimentation, and new media. 
             Contemporary modern artists often explore themes of social commentary, politics, and identity, and their work can be found in a variety of settings,
              including galleries, museums, private collections, and public spaces.
